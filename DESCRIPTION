Description: Builds decision trees by splitting on linear combinations of randomly chosen variables. Projection Pursuit (PP) is used to choose a projection of the variables that best separates the classes. Using linear combinations of variables to separate classes takes the correlation between variables into account which allows PPTree to outperform a traditional decision tree when separations between groups occurs in combinations of variables. PPTree models can be assembled into PPForest models, which correspond to the random forest version of the PPTree model.
