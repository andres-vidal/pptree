Description: PPtree constructs decision trees by splitting on linear combinations of randomly chosen variables. Projection Pursuit (PP) is used to choose a projection of the variables that best separates the classes. Using linear combinations of variables to separate classes takes the correlation between variables into account which allows PPTree to outperform a traditional random forest when separations between groups occurs in combinations of variables.
